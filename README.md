+ Projec title: What Lies Behind Voters' Choice? 
  --- A Data-Question Story on the Pre-Election Survey
  
+ This project is conducted by [Yutong Yang]

+ Project summary: 
 The *ANES 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey* was conducted for the purpose of **testing new questions and carrying out methodological research** to inform the design of the ANES 2020 Time Series study. The study relies on non-probability samples, and no sampling weights are provided. Therefore, the data might not be an ideal choice for making inferences about the distribution of opinions in the American electorate. 
 
  Nevertheless, the data set still reveals valuable information as it reflects what American voters think when they are provided with a long series of questions. Besides, this being the only available ANES data for 2020 presidential election makes it relatively appropriate for understanding the voters' opinion and choice.

  Taking the factors above into account, this data story will be conducted based on the ANES data set to discover what factors show highest significance to the voters choice. In the meantime, some other interesting insights would be gained.
  
  The analysis focuses on 8 main questions:
  Question1: What factors have the highest correlation with the voters’ choice?
  Question2: How does gender affect voters’ choice? 
  Question3: How does marital status affect voters’ choice? 
  Question4: How does educational level affect voters’ choice?
  Question5: What emotions are held by supporters for Trump and Biden? 
  Question6: How do supporters of Trump and Biden differ in their ethnicity?
  Question7: How do supporters of Trump and Biden differ in their voting history or other choices?
  Question8: What do supporters of Trump and Biden differ in their economic circumstances?
  
  In answering these questions, the study takes shape and visualization of data is also formed.
