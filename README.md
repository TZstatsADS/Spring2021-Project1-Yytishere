+ Projec title: What Lies Behind Voters' Choice? 
  --- A Data-Question Story on the Pre-Election Survey
  
+ This project is conducted by [Yutong Yang]

+ Project summary: 
 The *ANES 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey* was conducted for the purpose of **testing new questions and carrying out methodological research** to inform the design of the ANES 2020 Time Series study. As distinct from many ANES pilot surveys, the primary aim of the study was to allow for more targeted experimentation and testing of longer batteries of questions, with **less concern for estimation of population characteristics**. In line with these goals, the study relies on non-probability samples, and no sampling weights are provided. Therefore, the data might not be an ideal choice for making inferences about the distribution of opinions in the American electorate. 
 
  Nevertheless, the data set still reveals valuable information as it reflects what American voters think when they are provided with a long series of questions. Besides, this being the only available ANES data for 2020 presidential election makes it relatively appropriate for understanding the voters' opinion and choice.

  Taking the factors above into account, the data is chosen as the primary target of analysis. The data collection was conducted between **April 10, 2020 and April 18, 2020**. The combined final sample includes responses from *3,080* adult citizens from across the United States.
